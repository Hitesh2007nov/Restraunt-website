    Visually similar to a pizza, uttapam is a South Indian dish consisting of a batter (based on rice and lentils) that is
    fried and topped with chopped vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, carrots, chiles, and corn. There is also a version of
    the dish called mini uttapam, usually served in four pieces per portion, with variable toppings and a number of side
    dishes.
